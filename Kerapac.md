# Kerapac Normal Mode - 100% Loot
For Normal Mode Kerapac you only have to teleport to War's Retreat and have the customer finish off the boss.

# Kerapac Hard Mode - 100% Loot
Hard Mode Kerapac works a bit differently. To prevent the customer getting duplicate staff pieces it's important to also log out after teleporting, before the customer finishes off the boss.
