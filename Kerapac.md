# Kerapac Normal Mode - 100% Loot
Make sure `Lootshare` is on in either `FC` or `Group`.
For Normal Mode Kerapac you only have to teleport to War's Retreat and have the customer finish off the boss.

# Kerapac Hard Mode - 100% Loot
Hard Mode Kerapac works a bit differently. 

You do **not** need lootshare for this!
To prevent the customer getting duplicate staff pieces it's important to also log out after teleporting, before the customer finishes off the boss.

__Note__: Make sure you do not log back in before the customer has finished off the boss!
