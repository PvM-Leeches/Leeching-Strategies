# 7/7 Lootpiles
To share 100% loot to the customer, you'll have to use the lootshare in the `Grouping System`and [bladed dive](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bladed_Dive) to the other side of the arena once the boss is low health. The customer can then finish the boss, ideally by using the [Shatter](https://runescape.wiki/w/Shatter) ability.
