An overview of all of our available pages with information for both customers and sellers in the [PvM Leeches](https://discord.gg/pvmleeches) Discord server.

These pages will describe how the service should be sold and how you can guarantee loot for the customer.

Currently this document mainly discusses xlogs but in the future perhaps normal selling methods will be described too.

# Sales & Service Rules
Before selling anything, please read our rules for sales and the service in general first.
These can be found on the following page: [Sales & Service-Rules](wiki/Sales-&-Service-Rules)

# Ticketing System
A complete guide on how our ticketing system works can be found in [here](wiki/Ticketing-System).
If you have any questions feel free to tag `@Support` or `@Moderator`.

# Calculating Discounts
Kingofitness made us a calculator to calculate the discount a customer should be given.
This calculator can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x5W913xKnuAkrbwblcfmP8llr63oRjHyT66PVatbqjE/edit?usp=sharing)

One thing to note that it calculates it for ALL SALES even if the discount doesn't apply to that service. 

Below are the sales that are mentioned in the calculator but aren't actually discounted
- Bundles
- Skilling-supplies
- Personal-records 
- Xlogs
- Daredevil feats
- Token/XP farming

Another way to find out if discounts apply to the service you're looking to sell is by using the `/pcleeches` command, followed by the service name.

__Example__: `/pcleeches solak`
