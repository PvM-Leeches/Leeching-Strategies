# GWD 2 - 100% Loot
Lower down the boss's health to around 10k and teleport out.

__Note__: Due to recent changes you can't go into an instance until the boss has died. If you do, you'll risk rolling the drop to you.

# Kerapac
## Normal Mode

Make sure `Lootshare` is on in either `FC` or `Group`.
For Normal Mode Kerapac you only have to teleport to War's Retreat and have the customer finish off the boss.


## Hard Mode
Make sure you disable your teleport animation in your wardrobe for faster teleports. Teleport out at +- 40K HP left and lobby / log out before the customer finishes off the boss. The reason you have to log out is because otherwise you'll be forcing the next staff piece you're supposed to get to the customer. If you log out you'll force their next piece and not the seller's next piece. No lootshare is required.

__Note__: Make sure not to log back in before the customer has killed the boss.
