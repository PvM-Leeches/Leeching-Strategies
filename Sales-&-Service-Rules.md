# Sales Rules
**1.** All sales are to be added to add-to-completed without fail.

**2.** You represent this Service. What you say and how you act affects yourself and us. Obtaining leeches from outside the Service still falls onto Service rules.

**3.** Filling for Sales should always be done in this channel before going to Friends List/Reserves. If you've got a friend you always fill with please let us know who they are so we can give them the @reserves role!

**4.** Sellers always have priority over Friends list/Reserves.

**5.** All communication between a seller and a Customer is to be done within the Customer's ticket. Should the Customer DM you, refer them back to the ticket. The Service is unable to protect you from things that happen between a Seller and a Customer in DMs.

**6.** Calling for a Customer is mandatory in most sales. If you're providing a Service that doesn't require calls for a Customer no Voice Chat is needed.

**7.** Rage quitting is not tolerated. Please ensure a replacement is found, and communicated accordingly to the team, to ensure the sale is not jeopardised.

**8.** It is never the Customer's fault if a kill is failed. As sellers you should have the experience to adapt and ensure the Customer does not feel at fault.
