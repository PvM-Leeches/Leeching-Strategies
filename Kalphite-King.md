# 100% Loot
Make sure you don't have a teleport animation set (wardrobe -> animation -> teleport animation) or have set the shadow rip teleport as your animation.
You can then teleport when the Kalphite King dies to will force your loot to the customer. This allows you to stay in the instance until the kill is done.

# Defender Hunt
Just kill the Kalphite King and make sure you don't have a defender on you. This guarantees the customer will always be the one rolling for the defender.
