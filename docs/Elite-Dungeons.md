# 3/3 Lootpiles for all Dungeons
You'll have to use lootshare from the `Grouping System` and set the chests to drop your loot to the floor. Teleport out at about ~20-40k HP then re-enter the dungeon and stand near the barrier.

# Premium Token Farm - Elite Dungeons 4
Advise the customer if they are a HCIM that this can kill them. You should only take them if they acknowledge this and/or they have intercept unlocked and you are willing to do so every kill.

The boss can poison you so make sure to let them know to bring a form of antipoison.
Wars Retreat teleport for them will help speed things up however it is not needed.

Inform them that once the miniboss is dead they should teleport and then go back through the portal (Zamorak) as soon as possible and to only bank when absolutely necessary.

They should have at least tier 60 weapon in at least one style.
If they opt to use Magic tell them to use Earth spells.
The further away they are from the miniboss the lower their accuracy will be so tell them to go as close as possible without being tagged.
This is important because they MUST hit at least one ability in order to receive tokens from a kill.

Inform them to pray against Magic upon entering and until they enter the room with Cerberus in which they should then change pray against Melee.

Helpful unlocks / items for the leech to have but absolutely not needed:
Double Surge
Dive / Bladed Dive
Animate Dead

Once you enter you will:
Surge North towards the Mages > Barge a Mage > Run East and Surge > Run to the stairs then Bladed Dive / Dive through the building towards the door.

As of 17th of July 2023 this is the most optimal Magic rotation. Note you should only use 1 dominion mine per kill:
