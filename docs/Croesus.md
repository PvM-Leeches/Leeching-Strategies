# 100% Loot
This page will describe how to force loot to another account, for both mains and ironmen. 

The methods to force loot to someone else are the same for both Mains & Ironmen.

If a customer receives piles and you lost piles, the piles you lost should still be refunded.

`Kalun` also made an in-depth guide for Croesus, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nibTlJ93MfEp5n5mc_4o8ZUldfUaV-lBcjTct-THv1w/edit).

# Non-AFK Method
## Mains & Ironmen
Non-AFK: You enable lootshare in the `Friends Chat` and bladed dive to the corner of the instance when the kill is close to ending, north-east seems to be the easiest.

# AFK Method
## Mains & Ironmen
You enable lootshare in the `Friends Chat`, Customer/buyer cannot participate in first middle or statue building. Towards the end of the kill bladed dive to the corner of the instance around 10k remaining HP, north-east seems to be the easiest.

__Note__: AFK-Buyers do **NOT** do 1st or 2nd mid. This is to guarantee Sellers will always get the maximum amount of piles.

# 1-Mid Method
__Note__: To be able to sell this, you will have to apply for the 1-Mid role by opening an application ticket on Discord.

For 1 mid you gather 15 and deposit, gather 15 all from sparkling, any more you need get from dead guards. You then run then long (2) and deposit in the statue, withdraw the mats and take then short (1), repair statue. You do the first mid (leech does not), you take the soups relevant to your node & the node opposite you (long) example: if you're fish you take algae soups and timber soups and soup on those cores. In order to pass you will have to consistently meet a contribution requirement, always be at least at your end statue by mid spawn, if you are always at least long you will be expected to bring Artificer's & Con Outfit. Once everyone is 90%+ repaired you pray. If someone is severely behind when you're ready to pray (below 50%), you pray and help them then go to the core.
