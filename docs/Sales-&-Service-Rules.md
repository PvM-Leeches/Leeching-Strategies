# Sales Rules
**1.** All sales are to be added to add-to-completed without fail.

**2.** You represent this Service. What you say and how you act affects yourself and us. Obtaining leeches from outside the Service still falls onto Service rules.

**3.** Filling for Sales should always be done in this channel before going to Friends List/Reserves. If you've got a friend you always fill with please let us know who they are so we can give them the @reserves role!

**4.** Sellers always have priority over Friends list/Reserves.

**5.** All communication between a seller and a Customer is to be done within the Customer's ticket. Should the Customer DM you, refer them back to the ticket. The Service is unable to protect you from things that happen between a Seller and a Customer in DMs.

**6.** Calling for a Customer is mandatory in most sales. If you're providing a Service that doesn't require calls for a Customer no Voice Chat is needed.

**7.** Rage quitting is not tolerated. Please ensure a replacement is found, and communicated accordingly to the team, to ensure the sale is not jeopardised.

**8.** It is never the Customer's fault if a kill is failed. As sellers you should have the experience to adapt and ensure the Customer does not feel at fault.


# Service Rules
**1.** No toxicity or flame towards other Sellers, Customers or anyone else inside the Discord. What happens outside of the Discord should not be brought here. Please watch the language you use. If you have an issue with a Seller or Customer please let a @Moderator know. 

**2.** Selling account services is strictly forbidden within the Service as it can get us shut down and you banned. What you do outside of this Service is fully on you and we will not protect you.

**3.** Undercutting the Service/any Seller is not allowed. You will be removed from Sellers role if found doing this.

**4.** Leaking Customer tickets/Sellers/DM's is not allowed and will get you removed from Sellers role if found doing this.
