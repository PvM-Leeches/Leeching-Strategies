An overview of all of our available pages with information for both customers and sellers in the [PvM Leeches](https://discord.gg/pvmleeches) Discord server.

These pages will describe how the service should be sold and how you can guarantee loot for the customer.

Currently this document mainly discusses xlogs but in the future perhaps normal selling methods will be described too.

# Sales & Service Rules
Before selling anything, please read our rules for sales and the service in general first.
These can be found on the following page: [Sales & Service-Rules](wiki/Sales-&-Service-Rules)

# Ticketing System
A complete guide on how our ticketing system works can be found in [here](wiki/Ticketing-System).
If you have any questions feel free to tag `@Support` or `@Moderator`.

# Pinging Customers
There are a few ways you can find a customer for the service you're trying to sell.
The regular method is simply joining tickets and pinging the customer, asking if they're currently available.

There is however also a command you can use to ping all customers for a service you're trying to sell: `/pingcustomers`.
The command takes the following arguments: 
- `service_type` this would be one of the following: `Mainscape`, `Personal Records`, `Miscellaneous`, `Croesus` and `Dungeoneering`.
- `boss_category` this would be for example: `Vorago`
- `service_name` this would be the specific service you're trying to ping customers for, eg: `Vorago Reaper`
- **[Optional]** `max_minutes`, this parameter defines how long the customers get to indicate they're available. Defaults to `10` minutes and allows for a maximum of `60` minutes.


When you run this command, in this case with the "Kalphite King 100% Loot" service, you'll see the following appear:

When one of our customers clicks the `Available` button they'll get the following response:

After which the list of available customers will get updated.

# Calculating Discounts
Kingofitness made us a calculator to calculate the discount a customer should be given.
This calculator can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x5W913xKnuAkrbwblcfmP8llr63oRjHyT66PVatbqjE/edit?usp=sharing)

One thing to note that it calculates it for **ALL SALES** even if the discount doesn't apply to that service. 

Below are the sales that are mentioned in the calculator but aren't actually discounted
- Bundles
- Skilling-supplies
- Personal-records 
- Xlogs
- Daredevil feats
- Token/XP farming

Another way to find out if discounts apply to the service you're looking to sell is by using the `/pcleeches` command, followed by the service name.

__Example__: `/pcleeches solak`
