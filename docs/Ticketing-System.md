# Overview
When the customer creates a ticket and selects a service, a message will appear in the appropriate channel. For example: `#mainscape-orders`, `#ironman-orders` or `#skiller-orders`.

The order will follow this format:

- **1st part** the ticket channel, in this case: `#vindy-loot-blurred`.
- **2nd part** is the service they require, in this case: `Vindicta 100% Loot`.
- **3rd part** is the amount of kills / tokens / ... they require, in this case: `#`, meaning the amount is unspecified.

__Note__: If a ticket has no specified amount of kills, tokens, etc. it will say `#`.


As you can see there are also 3 buttons available on every order.

This button also allows you to leave the ticket if you've already joined it.

# Step By Step
- If you spot an order you're interested in, click the 
![Screenshot_from_2022-07-01_10-48-25](uploads/84c5d2e7a6601b13bf0e2647cd00b23b/Screenshot_from_2022-07-01_10-48-25.png) button to join it.
- Now you're able to talk with the customer to discuss a suitable time for you both.
- Form your team in `#sale-pings`, `#skilling-sellers`, etc.

Once the service is completed, click the ![Screenshot_from_2022-07-01_10-48-31](uploads/49868cc1ac2d06a5816095f40f90dad4/Screenshot_from_2022-07-01_10-48-31.png) button to mark the order as completed.

__Note__: 
- If the service listed `#` as amount, you will be asked how many kills you sold to the user and whether you would like to keep the order open or not.
- If you sold a different amount than the amount listed, you should preferably use the `/addtocomp` command inside of the customer's ticket or alternatively the`#add-to-completed` channel instead. If the order is then finished, delete it by pressing ![Screenshot_from_2022-07-01_10-48-37](uploads/8ad13997266dc5dbb8849467d0b23a87/Screenshot_from_2022-07-01_10-48-37.png).
